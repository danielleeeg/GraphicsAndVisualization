# Graphics And Visualization

## Design Approach

In designing software, I prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and maintainability. I start by understanding the problem domain thoroughly, breaking it down into smaller components or modules. Clear and concise communication is key, both with stakeholders and within the development team. I emphasize iterative development, continuously refining and improving the software based on feedback.

## New Design Skills

Working on this project has honed my skills in organizing geometry effectively, creating low-polygon 3D representations of real-world objects. I've learned to approach complex objects by breaking them down into their basic shapes and optimizing polygon counts while maintaining visual fidelity.

## Design Process

For this project, I followed a systematic design process:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding project requirements and constraints.
2. **Conceptualization**: Brainstorming and sketching ideas.
3. **Prototyping**: Creating initial low-fidelity 3D models.
4. **Feedback and Iteration**: Gathering feedback, refining designs, and iterating.
5. **Finalization**: Completing high-fidelity 3D models with textures and lighting.

## Application in Future Work

The tactics from my design approach, such as iterative development and effective communication, can be applied in future projects to streamline the development process, improve collaboration, and deliver high-quality software efficiently.

## Development Approach

I approach developing programs with a focus on modularization, efficiency, and readability. I break down tasks into smaller, manageable units, adhere to coding standards, and leverage appropriate design patterns and algorithms.

## New Development Strategies

During the development of the 3D scene, I employed strategies to optimize performance and enhance user experience. These include:
- Minimizing polygon count while preserving visual quality.
- Accurately applying textures to 3D models.
- Implementing lighting using components of the Phong shading model.

## Iteration in Development

Iteration played a crucial role in my development process. I continuously refined and improved the codebase based on testing, feedback, and evolving requirements. Each milestone brought enhancements and optimizations, contributing to the project's overall success.

## Evolution of Coding Approach

Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code evolved from initial prototyping and experimentation to a more structured and optimized implementation. I became more proficient in leveraging libraries, frameworks, and design patterns to solve complex problems efficiently.

## Role of Computer Science

Computer science provides a solid foundation for problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and abstraction. It equips me with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle diverse challenges in software development and beyond.
